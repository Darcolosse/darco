        <div class="mb-4">
            <p class="title-3 dark-shadow">Sports</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">I have had the opportunity to practice several sports in my life, including Judo for 4 years. This sport taught me how to stay calm and stick to my principles. Judo also taught me discipline, perseverance, and respect for others, values that still serve me today in my daily and professional life.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the sports I enjoyed the most was airsoft. This sport offered me a lot, especially in team management, quick decision-making, and efficient organization. Airsoft helped me develop skills in strategy, communication, and leadership, as it requires close coordination with teammates to achieve common goals.</p>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <p class="title-3 dark-shadow">Association</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">With my passion for airsoft, my team and I decided to create an association around airsoft. I was the founder and president of ESCOUADE ECHO. Creating an association taught me a lot, such as organizing events, managing accounts, and finding locations for our activities. This experience also helped me develop skills in project management, negotiation, and public relations.</p>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <p class="title-3 dark-shadow">Passions</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">My main interests in life are digital technology, home automation, and 3D printing. These fields fascinate me because they allow me to explore new technologies. I enjoy experimenting with different gadgets and software to automate tasks and make environments smarter.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Besides that, I also have a small passion for aeronautics and space. I had the chance to pass the BIA, which gave me a basic understanding of aeronautics. This passion opened my eyes to the endless possibilities of space exploration and made me want to continue learning and improving in this field.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">I intend to get my ULM license to pilot small aircraft. Obtaining this license would allow me to fulfill a childhood dream.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            <p class="title-3 dark-shadow">Event Participation</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">In the past, I have also organized major events like the CTF FLAG'MALO 2023. My main task was to focus on the infrastructure to support the CTF. This role helped me develop skills in system management, security, and team coordination, while contributing to the success of the event.</p>

        <div class="mb-4">
            <p class="title-3 dark-shadow">Une idée pour mon territoire</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">I had the opportunity to participate in "Une idée pour mon territoire". This event was about proposing a solution to a given theme. In my case, it was about sports in the Saint-Malo area. In groups of 5 students, we thought of a solution to better integrate Saint-Malo students into sports.</p>
