                    I'm currently studying for a degree in digital science engineering. 
                    Each semester reinforces acquired skills but also allows the acquisition of new ones.

                    During my fifth semester, I gained skills in enterprise networks, focusing on Internet protocols and network setup.
                    In programming, I applied a structured methodology through a practical project.
                    The engineering tools course reinforced my knowledge of probability, logic, and mathematics. 
                    Lastly, in computer architecture, I deepened my understanding of system design through a hands-on project.

                <p class="mx-4 me-5">
                    During my sixth semester, I deepened my knowledge of operated networks, focusing on long-distance networks and an introduction to telephone networks.
                    In object technology, I worked on object-oriented design and programming in Java, alongside a project that combined these skills with project management. 
                    Additionally, the engineering tools module enhanced my understanding of graph theory, automata, and databases, further strengthening my abilities in system modeling and management.
